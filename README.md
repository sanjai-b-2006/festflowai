## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üîí Role-Based Access Control:** A secure login system with three distinct user roles:
    *   **Student:** Can submit new expense claims.
    *   **Team Lead:** Can approve or reject expenses submitted by students.
    *   **Treasurer:** Manages the final approval, oversees the entire budget, and processes reimbursements.
*   **ü§ñ OCR-Powered Expense Submission:** Students can upload a receipt image, and the application uses Tesseract OCR to automatically extract the expense amount, simplifying the submission process.
*   **üö¶ Multi-Level Approval Workflow:** Expenses flow logically from student submission to Team Lead approval, and finally to Treasurer approval before reimbursement.
*   **üìä Interactive Financial Dashboard:** The Treasurer has access to a real-time dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs) like total budget, amount spent, and remaining funds. It includes interactive charts from Plotly to visualize:
    *   Spending by category.
    *   Cumulative spending over time.
    *   Top spenders.
    *   Overall expense status distribution.
*   **üìÑ Dual-Format Report Generation:** The Treasurer can generate a final, consolidated financial report in two formats:
    *   **PDF:** A formal, human-readable report for official documentation.
    *   **JSON:** A structured, machine-readable format perfect for data analysis or integration with other systems.
*   **‚úçÔ∏è Complete Activity Log:** An immutable audit trail that logs every significant action taken within the system, providing transparency and accountability.

## üöÄ How to Run the Application

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

1.  **Python:** Make sure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed.
2.  **Tesseract-OCR Engine:** This is a system dependency, **not** a Python package. You must install it on your operating system.
    *   **Windows:** Download and run the installer from [Tesseract at UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). During installation, make sure to add it to your system's PATH.
    *   **macOS:** Use Homebrew: `brew install tesseract`
    *   **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):** `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

    _**Note for Windows Users:**_ The file `ocr_processor.py` contains a line `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'`. Ensure this path matches your Tesseract installation location.

### **Step 1: Get the Code**

Download or clone the project files to a folder on your computer.

### **Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment**

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate into the project folder, and create a virtual environment. This isolates the project's dependencies.

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd path/to/your/festflow-ai

# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
